/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
  counter 1 defines count within the scope of the function counterMaker() and returns a function which returns a change in the count variable. Count is defined outside of the inner function's scope.
  counter 2 defines count within the global scope and returns a change in the count variable
  
  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
  counter 2 is a closure because the inner function references the variable count outside of its scope. counter1 is not a closure however, the inner function counter() is a closure. 
  
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  
     counter 1 would be better to create a new counter starting at 0 when required. Like at the start of a new game. We could also assign the function to a variable, allowing us to declare multiple games by invoking counterMaker
     counter 2 is much simpler and would be better if only starting from 0 once.

Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below

Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 5: scoreboard() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score.
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:

  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
